# ProGrad-Music-Player

It is the Self-Project of Prograd Course in which I have created a Music Player Web Application using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It shows the song name and the artist name along with a song cover image above it.
It can be used to listen favourite songs of the user and currently we are providing songs and music from the Open Source API freemusicarchive.org .
The backgroud changes randomly to different colors to provide aesthetic vibes and music volume can be controlled manually under the option to change songs which gives the user free choice.

Below is an example screenshot of the Web-Application:
